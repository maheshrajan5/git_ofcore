Trying to learn git hub and put in it some significant example for build, run and test.
Started with building 'ofcore' my out of core complex linear equation dense solver on my linux laptop Shakhti.

This required installing netlib lapack from www.netlib.org/lapack and building it with gfortran on my laptop and testing a simple 100x100 matrix out of core solver on my laptop

NOTE:  Link line should use the following two libraries I built with the linpack download:  librefblas.a liblapack.a
in my directory /home/mrajan/lapack/lapack-3.8.0

It is giving some warnings on build and on run "denormal' at some function that does not seem to impact the solution as the errors are of the order 10 to th -8 power.
