Created git repository git_ofcore

Want to put my ofcore complex linear equation solver in there and see if I can learn all about git and git runner using my own git hub that I created.

I then plan to move it to NMC git hub and repeat if psooible

I then plan to instrument it with OSS, TAU, Caliper and use that to understand
how to create instrumented images and then run nightly tests with TRAVIS or whatever we want to learn.

Down the road I want to try using spack to build ofcore, OSS, TAU , Caliper and see if we can vary GNU to Intel compilers and different libraries such as MKL, netlib-blas.

The try to introduce threading to measure OMP parallel efficiency.

Then may be we can try integrate one of the ST packages VIZ+DATA reserach products.
